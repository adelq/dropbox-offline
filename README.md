dropbox-offline
===============

A Chrome extension to make Dropbox files available offline using modern web technologies.
This will likely be built upon the new HTML5 Filesystem APIs to provide a subset of the user's files available offline.
This is particularly useful on devices such as Chromebooks and mobile devices which do not have a dedicated offline Dropbox client.
